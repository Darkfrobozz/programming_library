This follows a [[stack]] data structure, [[name_spaces]] that are defined first are released last.

An important feature of this memory is that all data stored here must have a known size at compile time that does not change.

The simplicity of the [[stack]] leads to a very quick access and storing of values.

An example of a stack value is an integer, i32 for example.
